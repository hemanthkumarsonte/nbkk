        <h3>Affiliation with Budokan Karate-Do International
        </h3>

        <p>NBKA is proudly affiliated with Budokan Karate-Do International, a globally recognized organization that has
            been
            instrumental in spreading the art and philosophy of karate across the world. Established in 1966 by Grand
            Master
            Chew Choo Soot in Malaysia, Budokan Karate-Do International combines the essence of traditional martial arts
            with a modern approach to discipline and self-defense.
        </p>
        <p>Grand Master Chew Choo Soot, a master of multiple martial arts forms, founded Budokan Karate-Do with the
            vision
            of creating a comprehensive style that would blend the best techniques and philosophies of various
            disciplines.
            His dedication laid the groundwork for what has become a worldwide movement, inspiring millions to embrace
            the
            transformative power of karate.

        </p>

        <p>In 1978, Budokan Karate-Do found its way to India through the efforts of Grand Master C. Hanumanth Rao, who
            was
            personally mentored by Chew Choo Soot. Recognizing Hanumanth Rao’s exceptional skill and leadership
            qualities,
            Grand Master Chew entrusted him with the responsibility of nurturing and expanding the Budokan legacy in
            India.
            With this responsibility, Hanumanth Rao established a strong foundation for Budokan Karate-Do in India,
            training
            thousands of students and ensuring its teachings reached every corner of the country.
        </p>

        <p>Grand Master C. Hanumanth Rao’s efforts not only preserved the principles of Budokan Karate-Do but also
            elevated
            its stature on the global stage. His unwavering dedication has inspired numerous instructors and students,
            including P. Ganesh Nayak, who continues to carry forward this prestigious legacy through NBKA.
        </p>

        <p>Budokan Karate-Do International remains a unifying platform for martial artists, with its presence in
            countries
            worldwide. NBKA’s affiliation with this esteemed organization ensures that its students receive training
